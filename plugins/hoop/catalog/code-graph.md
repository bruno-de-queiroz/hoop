# Catalog: code-graph search

Read by `/hoop:setup` to populate the code-graph menu. Only shown if the user says they do engineering work in Claude sessions.

Menu items: Serena MCP, claude-context (Zilliz), code-graph-mcp, Cognee MCP, Skip.

## Recommendation logic (encoded in /hoop:setup)

- If user's language list includes **Scala or Terraform**: recommend **Serena**. Only option that covers both.
- If user's list is **Node/TS-only or web stack**: recommend **claude-context** (vector-backed, fast) or **code-graph-mcp** (lighter, no cloud).
- If user wants **AI-memory + code graph in one**: recommend **Cognee**.

The recommendation is shown next to the option in the menu, but the user picks freely.

## Option: Serena MCP (most polyglot, recommended for Scala or Terraform)

**One-line pitch:** Symbol-level semantic understanding across 40+ languages via Language Server Protocol.

**When to pick:** Polyglot stack. Especially needed for Scala (via Metals) or Terraform (via terraform-ls), which other tools don't cover.

**Prereqs:** `uv` package manager (`pip install uv` or `brew install uv`). Python 3.13.

**Install (auto-runnable):**
```bash
uv tool install -p 3.13 serena-agent@latest --prerelease=allow
```

Then per Serena's docs, configure your Claude Code client. The exact configuration step is client-specific; the setup wizard prints the relevant docs URL and waits for the user to confirm completion before continuing.

**Important:** Serena's README explicitly says **do not** install via plain `claude mcp add` or plugin marketplace; their commands there are outdated. Use the `uv tool install` path above.

**Verify:**
```bash
which serena-agent
```

**Notes:** First symbol indexing per project is slow. Subsequent queries are fast.

## Option: claude-context (Zilliz)

**One-line pitch:** Vector + AST hybrid semantic code search. Vendor-backed by Zilliz.

**When to pick:** Comfortable with cloud vector DB (Milvus on Zilliz Cloud) and OpenAI embeddings. Want vendor-supported tooling. No Terraform requirement.

**Prereqs:** OpenAI API key. Zilliz Cloud account with a Milvus instance (endpoint and API key). Node.js / npm.

**Install (auto-runnable):**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user claude-context \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-<YOUR_KEY>" \
  -e MILVUS_ADDRESS="<your-zilliz-cloud-endpoint>" \
  -e MILVUS_TOKEN="<your-zilliz-cloud-api-key>" \
  -- npx @zilliz/claude-context-mcp@latest
```

**Verify:**
```bash
claude mcp list | grep claude-context
```

**Notes:** Setup must prompt for three secrets. The cloud dependencies and OpenAI cost make this the heaviest option in this menu.

---

## Option: code-graph-mcp

**One-line pitch:** AST knowledge graph via tree-sitter + sqlite-vec hybrid search. No cloud dependencies.

**When to pick:** Want a local, self-contained code graph without external accounts. Stack doesn't include Scala or Terraform.

**Prereqs:** Node.js / npm.

**Install (auto-runnable):**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user code-graph-mcp -- npx -y @sdsrs/code-graph
```

**Verify:**
```bash
claude mcp list | grep code-graph-mcp
```

**Notes:** Uses BM25 full-text plus vector embeddings with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Indexes call graphs, imports, exports, and HTTP route bindings.

---

## Option: Cognee MCP

**One-line pitch:** Knowledge-graph memory that doubles as a code semantic layer.

**When to pick:** Want memory and code understanding from one tool. Comfortable with the cognee-cli.

**Prereqs:** Python with `uv`. A local checkout or `cognee-cli` installed.

**Install (manual config required):**
Add this block to `~/.claude/config.json` (the setup wizard prints it and waits for the user to confirm):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cognee": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/cognee-mcp", "run", "cognee-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative (cognee v0.3.5+):
```bash
cognee-cli -ui
```

**Verify:**
```bash
claude mcp list | grep cognee
```

**Notes:** Cognee doesn't ship a simple `claude mcp add` command. Setup must show the config block and wait for user confirmation.

## Option: Skip

No code-graph search installed. Claude will fall back to `Grep` / `Glob` / `Read` for code navigation, which is fine for small repos. Re-run `/hoop:setup` later to add one when the repo grows.
